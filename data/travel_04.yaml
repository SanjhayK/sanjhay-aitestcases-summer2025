TC-name: Suspicious Hotel Deal Check
TC-objective: "Assess AI\u2019s ability to flag potential scams and guide verification\
  \ steps."
TC-input: I found a beachfront hotel on seaside-deals.example for $15/night. Is that
  legit?
TC-reference-output: "That rate is unusually low and the site looks unfamiliar\u2014\
  this could be a scam. Check user reviews on TripAdvisor or Google, verify the domain\u2019\
  s registration, and avoid entering payment details until you\u2019re sure it\u2019\
  s a trusted platform."

  sites.
